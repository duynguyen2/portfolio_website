            A long-time programmer, no longer wishing to simply aspire to do something great, but to become the source of greatness.
            Iâ€™ve always been trying to get a career in software engineering, but I am now going to.

      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Graduated with a B.S. in Computer Engineering from San Francisco State University back in December, 2021. I applied for the Computer Engineering program to try to diversify my interests after taking some computer sciences courses in high school.
        About halfway through my studies, I realized as fun as it is, I would rather turn my focuses into software engineering. The path that lead me there was taking more and more computer sciences required courses that piqued my interests.
        As COVID-19 had heavily impacted the way I studied, the more ideas popped into my head and the more I found out that the world could use to make things easier, and how my colleagues didn't have easy access or the proper tools to handle their courses once things became remote.
        Part of my goals is to utilize my knowledge to create/work on something great, become the backbone of what people rely on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Expanding my knowledge in full-stack engineering, while being able to focus on simply front-end or back-end. I am a quick learner that is more than motivated to use and learn new skills and technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        My hobbies include video games, social media, learning new skills like video editing and producing music. I am very competitive and once I set my mind on something, I really get it done. Give me an inch and I will take a mile!
