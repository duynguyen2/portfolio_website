                <a href="#">About my work</a>
                <p>Hi, I’m Duy Nguyen, an aspiring software engineer with a passion for web development and a solid foundation
                    in computer engineering. I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in
                    Computer Engineering from San Francisco State University,
                    with a strong academic background in algorithms, software
                    design, and system architecture.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Although I am quite new to professional
                    software development, during this period I have
                    been able to enhance my professional skills through
                    personal projects, including such a portfolio website
                    as I am developing right now. Currently, I am focused on web technologies: HTML,
                    CSS, JavaScript, and React-though I'm also studying backend
                    development using Node.js along with databases. Each project is a
                    chance to learn, experiment, and apply my knowledge in practical
                    real-life scenarios.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I had earned valuable customer-facing experience as a
                    retail sales associate before diving into the world of
                    software development and currently working as a helpdesk
                    technician at Lick-Wilmerding High School. It is through these
                    positions that my problem-solving,
                    communication, and ability to work under pressure have been
                    fine-tuned-skills that I feel are important to a successful tech career.
                    These roles have sharpened my problem-solving abilities,
                    communication skills, and ability to work under pressure—traits that
                    I believe are essential for a successful career in tech.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I’m eager to leverage both my technical skills and interpersonal
                    experiences to contribute to a forward-thinking team.
                    If you’re looking for a passionate, quick learner with a solid work
                    ethic and a drive to grow, I’d love to connect.</p>
