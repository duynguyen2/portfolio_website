#Duy N's Portfolio
Hello, my name is Duy and this is my portfolio! Though I have an undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering, I've come to realize that I would much rather be a software engineer.
I've grown up on technology and it's always fascinated me, and while I like working with hardware and building cool things, my interest much rather lies in software.
The small things that become the vital backbone of the technologies we use in our everyday lives is what truly impacted me to take this path.

##Programming Languages
The languages I studied back in school were Java, C, C++ and a bit of C# and Python. My courses taught Java, C and C++ to work with physical circuits while C# and Python were things I briefly studied on my own to build projects I worked on that can be browsed on profile.

The languages I am still learning while also making a name for myself with are JavaScript and HTML5. I am learning to work with technologies like Node.js
